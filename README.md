### Opinion on React and Vue
Based on my research, React and Vue have many similarities. The main difference is that Vue uses HTML templates except for JSX, while React uses JSX exceptionally. React is a library and Vue is a framework. According to this article https://radixweb.com/blog/react-vs-vue, React is more flexible as it lets you install any component of your choice. While Vue is not as flexible it suggests particular components, which makes it a good choice for new programmers. React is also more scalable because it allows developers to write template code in javascript while Vue uses HTML for templating. The article says Vue is a good choice if you need to work on a small project to learn and complete fast, create progressive web apps, or scale up the functionality of a current app. I preferred Vue in this project because it is very approachable as a beginner and it had documentation on creating slider components using Veutify and using the v-model component to change the variables made more sense then Reactâ€™s use State. I tried using the Fluent UI design language, but I had trouble trying to install Fluent UI for Vue on replit. I had difficulty because I was trying to install Fluent UI for Vue on replit, but was struggling and when I tried to install different packages for Fluent UI because they did not look the same as other apps. I think they looked different because the Fluent UI for React was a different version of Fluent UI. Because of this I ended up using material design to try to make the projects look the same and had no problems with that. I also tried using Angular, but there was problems with that and replit. I ended up forking a Angular template on Replit and it did work initially, but when I tried on the school computer it stopped working for some reason. In conclusion I did prefer using Vue as a starting point, but I think I should learn both React and Vue because React has its advantages that might be useful in the future.
